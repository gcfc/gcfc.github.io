# This is the Github repository of my personal website, based on an open-source template. 

Date started: July 21, 2019 (Ah the days when vibe coding was not a thing yet)

Languages used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Version: v2.2

This site began as a fun side project during a summer break and became my first introduction to web development. I initially hosted it on MITâ€™s server, but after graduating and losing access to my credentials, I migrated everything to GitHub. The project has since evolved alongside my skills and continues to serve as both a personal site and a learning playground.
